# recipe

Given a list of items in the fridge (presented as a csv list), and a collection of recipes (a collection of JSON formatted recipes), produce a recommendation for what to cook tonight.
Program should be written to take two inputs; fridge csv list, and the json recipe data. You can write it as a web page which takes input through a form.
The only rule is that it must run and return a valid result using the provided input data.

fridge csv
Format: item, amount, unit, use-by
Where;
Item (string) = the name of the ingredient â€“ e.g. egg)
Amount (int) = the amount
Unit (enum) = the unit of measure, values;
of (for individual items; eggs, bananas etc)
grams
ml (milliliters)
slices
Use-By (date) = the use by date of the ingredient (dd/mm/yy)
e.g.
